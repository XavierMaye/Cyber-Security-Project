and modified......save ..generate.......

kali& nano ~/kali-autopilot/test/test.py    

.......python code ....

/mutex.txt

users ={'offsect':'offsect'}    ###you can change to different name...

api_port =443

....def check_deployment():

................etho... ...###you an change interface  or API port....here.

def attack():     you can see 

subnet...

kp_ip...

delay.......etc... etc....



how to run script:
